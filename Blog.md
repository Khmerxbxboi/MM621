## Reading Discussions 


Reading Chapter #1
<BR>
Reading Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things made me think about how design connects deeply with culture. Norman‚Äôs idea of affordances (p. 10) stood out, how an object‚Äôs form suggests its use. In Cambodia, I see this in traditional designs like cooking stoves or water jars. Their shapes clearly show how to use them without needing written directions. It‚Äôs reality of life there similar to hear but more ancient I beleive, built from generations of shared understanding. Norman also highlights visibility and feedback (p. 15) as critical for good design. I realized that when using imported technologies like ticket kiosks or washing machines, the lack of clear feedback often causes confusion and also inspiration by using our mind to think as "critical thinking". This made me appreciate how local design often feels more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù because it‚Äôs grounded in lived experience from both cutlure of Cambodia to Cambodia. Norman‚Äôs ideas helped me see that good design isn‚Äôt just about modernity of life... it‚Äôs about understanding people, context, and culture.

Reading Chapter #2
<BR>
The Psychology of Everyday Actions in the Streets of Oakland = Reading Chapter 2 of The Design of Everyday Things made me think about how much design depends on understanding how people really act, not how designers think we act. Norman‚Äôs seven stages of action (p. 36) ... from setting goals to evaluating result, explain why so many products fail in real life. Out here in East Oakland, you see that every day. People don‚Äôt read manuals; they experiment. You learn by doing, messing up, fixing it, and trying again. That‚Äôs the real psychology of everyday action ‚Äî survival through trial and error.
Norman also talks about constraints (p. 41) = physical, cultural, and logical limits that help guide our behavior. In the streets, constraints are everywhere. A locked gate, a one-way street, or even social boundaries and crime rate high in the sky of DEEP EAST. they all shape how people move and adapt. I started noticing how community design ‚Äî from corner stores to bus stops ‚Äî often ignores how people actually use space. When official design fails, people redesign the environment themselves. A bench becomes a hangout spot; a milk crate becomes a seat. That‚Äôs human-centered design in its rawest form.
One line that stuck with me was Norman‚Äôs reminder that errors are not always our fault (p. 50). Sometimes the system is just built wrong. That hit me because a lot of frustration in daily life, especially in working class neighborhoods, comes from systems designed without us in mind. Whether it‚Äôs confusing digital kiosks, broken infrastructure, or public services that assume access we don‚Äôt have, the design problem isn‚Äôt the people ‚Äî it‚Äôs the design.
Norman‚Äôs ideas made me respect how people in Oakland constantly redesign their surroundings to make life work. It‚Äôs not always pretty, but it‚Äôs smart, adaptable, and deeply human, exactly what Norman says good design should be

Reading Chapter #3
<BR>

In Chapter 4, Don Norman talks about how people figure out what actions are possible when they use something new ... through constraints, discoverability, and feedback. He explains how good design gives clues about what can or can‚Äôt be done, without needing a manual.
I connected deeply to Norman‚Äôs idea of constraints (physical, cultural, semantic, and logical). In East Oakland, design has always felt real and physical which we stand to the top of the level of life from how we fix bikes or rewire speakers using what we got, to how street art is shaped by the walls and textures around us. Those are real physical constraints, just like Norman describes with batteries or plugs. We learn to create within limits, which is also part of Cambodian (Angkor-style) design ??? using what‚Äôs around you to build something timeless and spiritual.
Norman‚Äôs example of orientation-insensitive batteries made me think of designing technology that feels human, like the goal of my startup Sodaro. It‚Äôs not just about looking clean, it‚Äôs about making the tech feel like it understands you. When Norman talks about making things that eliminate user error, I think about how our apps or visuals could be intuitive enough that anyone ‚Äî whether from a temple village or a street in Oakland ‚Äî could use them naturally, without frustration.
The idea of activity-centered controls (pp. 140‚Äì141) also hit me. Norman talks about designing for the whole activity, not just the device ‚Äî like ‚Äúmovie mode‚Äù instead of adjusting every setting manually. That‚Äôs exactly how I want to approach design  not just giving users buttons, but giving them moods, actions, and experiences that flow. In my work, I call this cultural flow design ‚Äî where UX feels spiritual and street at the same time.
Overall, this part of the book made me realize that good design feels invisible, but its presence changes behavior and emotion. Whether it‚Äôs a temple, a turntable, or a trading app, the design should speak in silence .... guiding people through feeling, not force. That‚Äôs the balance I want Sodaro to capture, peaceful tech born from real struggle and rhythm.

We learned about interaction by examining something as simple as a sink. Why is the sink built this way? How can it be improved so that anyone can use it? The key lesson is to remember that you are designing for all people, not just yourself. I realized the importance of building for **everyone universally**.
