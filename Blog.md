## Reading Discussions 


Reading Chapter #1
<BR>
Reading Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things made me think about how design connects deeply with culture. Norman’s idea of affordances (p. 10) stood out, how an object’s form suggests its use. In Cambodia, I see this in traditional designs like cooking stoves or water jars. Their shapes clearly show how to use them without needing written directions. It’s reality of life there similar to hear but more ancient I beleive, built from generations of shared understanding. Norman also highlights visibility and feedback (p. 15) as critical for good design. I realized that when using imported technologies like ticket kiosks or washing machines, the lack of clear feedback often causes confusion and also inspiration by using our mind to think as "critical thinking". This made me appreciate how local design often feels more “human” because it’s grounded in lived experience from both cutlure of Cambodia to Cambodia. Norman’s ideas helped me see that good design isn’t just about modernity of life... it’s about understanding people, context, and culture.

Reading Chapter #2
<BR>
The Psychology of Everyday Actions in the Streets of Oakland = Reading Chapter 2 of The Design of Everyday Things made me think about how much design depends on understanding how people really act, not how designers think we act. Norman’s seven stages of action (p. 36) ... from setting goals to evaluating result, explain why so many products fail in real life. Out here in East Oakland, you see that every day. People don’t read manuals; they experiment. You learn by doing, messing up, fixing it, and trying again. That’s the real psychology of everyday action — survival through trial and error.
Norman also talks about constraints (p. 41) = physical, cultural, and logical limits that help guide our behavior. In the streets, constraints are everywhere. A locked gate, a one-way street, or even social boundaries and crime rate high in the sky of DEEP EAST. they all shape how people move and adapt. I started noticing how community design — from corner stores to bus stops — often ignores how people actually use space. When official design fails, people redesign the environment themselves. A bench becomes a hangout spot; a milk crate becomes a seat. That’s human-centered design in its rawest form.
One line that stuck with me was Norman’s reminder that errors are not always our fault (p. 50). Sometimes the system is just built wrong. That hit me because a lot of frustration in daily life, especially in working class neighborhoods, comes from systems designed without us in mind. Whether it’s confusing digital kiosks, broken infrastructure, or public services that assume access we don’t have, the design problem isn’t the people — it’s the design.
Norman’s ideas made me respect how people in Oakland constantly redesign their surroundings to make life work. It’s not always pretty, but it’s smart, adaptable, and deeply human, exactly what Norman says good design should be

Reading Chapter #3
<BR>
In Chapter 3, Don Norman talks about how people figure out what actions are possible when they use something new ... through constraints, discoverability, and feedback. He explains how good design gives clues about what can or can’t be done, without needing a manual.
I connected deeply to Norman’s idea of constraints (physical, cultural, semantic, and logical). In East Oakland, design has always felt real and physical which we stand to the top of the level of life from how we fix bikes or rewire speakers using what we got, to how street art is shaped by the walls and textures around us. Those are real physical constraints, just like Norman describes with batteries or plugs. We learn to create within limits, which is also part of Cambodian (Angkor-style) design ??? using what’s around you to build something timeless and spiritual.
Norman’s example of orientation-insensitive batteries made me think of designing technology that feels human, like the goal of my startup Sodaro. It’s not just about looking clean, it’s about making the tech feel like it understands you. When Norman talks about making things that eliminate user error, I think about how our apps or visuals could be intuitive enough that anyone — whether from a temple village or a street in Oakland — could use them naturally, without frustration.
The idea of activity-centered controls (pp. 140–141) also hit me. Norman talks about designing for the whole activity, not just the device — like “movie mode” instead of adjusting every setting manually. That’s exactly how I want to approach design  not just giving users buttons, but giving them moods, actions, and experiences that flow. In my work, I call this cultural flow design — where UX feels spiritual and street at the same time.
Overall, this part of the book made me realize that good design feels invisible, but its presence changes behavior and emotion. Whether it’s a temple, a turntable, or a trading app, the design should speak in silence .... guiding people through feeling, not force. That’s the balance I want Sodaro to capture, peaceful tech born from real struggle and rhythm.

Reading Chapter #4
<BR>
This part of the book talks about how good design helps people use things the right way. Don Norman explains that designers can guide users by setting limits, called constraints, so people don’t make mistakes, like how a USB only fits one way. There are physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints that shape how we use things. He also talks about conventions, or common habits we already know, such as a handle meaning “pull.” Good design keeps these familiar patterns so people can use objects easily without instructions. Norman uses faucets as an example some are confusing, but a well-designed one should make sense just by looking at it. Finally, he says that sound can also help, like a click or beep that tells us something worked. Overall, the main idea is that design should guide us naturally and clearly.
"In the beginning of Chapter 4, Don Norman says that good design helps people use things the right way by using constraints — built-in limits that show what you can or can’t do.
Physical constraints are from the real world, like a plug that only fits one way.
 Cultural constraints come from social rules, like red meaning stop.
 Logical constraints use common sense to guide users.
Norman explains that these limits work together to make products easy to understand instead of confusing.
 He also talks about conventions, or habits that most people already know, like how a door handle usually means pull.
 When designers follow both constraints and conventions, people can use things without needing extra signs or instructions.
 The main idea is that good design should guide behavior naturally through its shape and feedback "not just words or warnings."
This idea connects to the Cambodian bamboo house example.
 Its physical constraint is the stilt design, which keeps people safe from floods and snakes.
 Its cultural constraint is how people remove their shoes before entering, a local custom built into the raised porch.
 And its logical constraint is the single ladder and one entrance, which makes the correct way to enter obvious.
 Just like Norman’s ideas, the house shows how design and culture can shape people’s actions naturally.

Reading #5

Reading Discussion 5 - The Design of Everyday Things (Ch.5: Human Error)

By Bulli Sot

In Chapter 5 of The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman reframes “human error” as a design problem rather than a user flaw. He explains how most mistakes stem from poor design feedback, unclear constraints, or mismatched conceptual models. What stood out to me was his idea that “the designer must assume all possible errors will happen—and design for them.” This mindset changed how I think about both technology and cultural design.

As someone who grew up surrounded by the architectural wonders of Angkor Wat, I see parallels between ancient Cambodian design and Norman’s principles. The temples weren’t just built for beauty—they were designed for experience, navigation, and storytelling. Every path, doorway, and carving guides the user (the pilgrim or traveler) intuitively toward the central sanctuary. The builders designed for the human journey, reducing confusion through visual and spatial cues—the same goal Norman calls “error-tolerant design.”

In modern UX and interaction design, we’re doing the same thing—creating pathways for users to succeed even when they make mistakes. Whether in apps, websites, or startup systems like my project Sodaro, good design should make complexity feel natural and forgiving.

Design, like Angkor Wat, is a reflection of life itself: patience, iteration, and harmony between structure and spirit. When we understand that every error is an invitation to improve, we begin to design with empathy and purpose.
