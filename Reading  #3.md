Reading Discussion 3: Chapter 4 (pp. 125–141) – The Design of Everyday Things

By Bulli Sot

In Chapter 4, Don Norman talks about how people figure out what actions are possible when they use something new ... through constraints, discoverability, and feedback. He explains how good design gives clues about what can or can’t be done, without needing a manual.

I connected deeply to Norman’s idea of constraints (physical, cultural, semantic, and logical). In East Oakland, design has always felt real and physical which we stand to the top of the level of life from how we fix bikes or rewire speakers using what we got, to how street art is shaped by the walls and textures around us. Those are real physical constraints, just like Norman describes with batteries or plugs. We learn to create within limits, which is also part of Cambodian (Angkor-style) design ??? using what’s around you to build something timeless and spiritual.

Norman’s example of orientation-insensitive batteries made me think of designing technology that feels human, like the goal of my startup Sodaro. It’s not just about looking clean, it’s about making the tech feel like it understands you. When Norman talks about making things that eliminate user error, I think about how our apps or visuals could be intuitive enough that anyone — whether from a temple village or a street in Oakland — could use them naturally, without frustration.

The idea of activity-centered controls (pp. 140–141) also hit me. Norman talks about designing for the whole activity, not just the device — like “movie mode” instead of adjusting every setting manually. That’s exactly how I want to approach design  not just giving users buttons, but giving them moods, actions, and experiences that flow. In my work, I call this cultural flow design — where UX feels spiritual and street at the same time.

Overall, this part of the book made me realize that good design feels invisible, but its presence changes behavior and emotion. Whether it’s a temple, a turntable, or a trading app, the design should speak in silence .... guiding people through feeling, not force. That’s the balance I want Sodaro to capture, peaceful tech born from real struggle and rhythm.
